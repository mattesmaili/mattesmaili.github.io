## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I will be graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) starting Fall 2024. I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please check out my new Instagram page, [Razi ba Riazi](https://www.instagram.com/razibariazi), for cool mathematics videos, PhD advice, and more! Also feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about anything above :^)

### Theorem of the Week, July 22-26 2024

Let $f : [0, 1] \to \mathbb{R}$ be smooth with $f(0) = f(1) = 0$. Then $\int_0^1f^2(x)\text{d}x \leq \frac{1}{\pi^2}\int_0^1f'(x)^2\text{d}x$.

### Song of the Month, July 22-26 2024

**Loving You (Michael Jackson):** I can't believe the beautiful original version of [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Yo0Jz7YDAEPKsklNfQTA6?si=f90c52e5876f4107) didn't make it onto the BAD album!
