## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, January 29-February 2, 2024

Let $r \in \mathbb{P}^{>1}$ be an irrational number larger than $1$. The **Beatty Sequence** for $r$ is given by $\mathcal{B}(r) = (\lfloor r\rfloor, \lfloor 2r\rfloor, \lfloor 3r\rfloor, \ldots)$, which consists of the floor of each integer multiple of $r$. Well, for every $r \in \mathbb{P}^{>1}$, there exists $s \in \mathbb{P}^{>1}$ such that $\mathcal{B}(r) \sqcup \mathcal{B}(s) = \mathbb{Z}^{>0}$, i.e. the two sequences exactly partition the positive integers into two sets! 

As an example, $\mathcal{B}(\pi) = (3, 6, 9, 12, \ldots)$ and $\mathcal{B}(\tfrac{\pi}{\pi-1}) = (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, \ldots)$. Isn't that neat! (Hint: it will always be the H\"older conjugate of $r$). 


### Song of the Week, January 29-February 2, 2024

**Girlfriend:** [This song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1nCV2d1RAch7t2kRmwet5N?si=67ef5d4a23ac4fa9) by Michael Jackson is such an underrated bop! I absolutely love the bass line and that little synthesizer that comes in at 0:10.
