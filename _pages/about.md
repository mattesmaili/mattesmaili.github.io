## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, March 15-29, 2024

For $x> 0$, let us define $\pi(x)$ to be all primes $p \leq x$, and also define $m(x)$ as $all p \in \pi(x)$ such that $p$ divides $2^n+1$ for some integer $n\geq1$. Then guess what... $\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{|\pi(x)|}{|m(x)|} = \frac{17}{24}$. This is essentially saying that the "density" of primes which divide numbers of the form $2^n + 1$ is $tfrac{17}{24} = 70.8\overline{3}\%$ of all the primes!

### Song of the Week, March 25-29, 2024

**Harvest Moon:** In celebration of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young being back on Spotify this week, I thought it only made sense to include [this beautiful love song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5l9c6bJmzvftumhz4TMPgk?si=8fa77d9ca5ca41c2) as my song of the week!
