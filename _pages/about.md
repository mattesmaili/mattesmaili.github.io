## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/home?authuser=0). I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of mathematics with statistical methods, such as universality, free probability, and random matrix theory. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, pottery, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Clairo, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, and Chopin.

I do private tutoring for both statistics and mathematics. Please feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:matthewmallory@fas.harvard.edu) if you would like tutoring for courses in the Harvard Statistics department, or anything else more general. Also check out my Instagram page, [Razi ba Riazi](https://www.instagram.com/razibariazi), for cool mathematics videos, PhD advice, and more. 

### Theorem of the Week, March 3-7 2025

An integer $n \geq 1$ is called *perfect* if it is the sum of its proper divisors. For example, $6 = 1+2+3$ is perfect. As it stands, there are only 51 perfect numbers known, and they are all even! It is unknown if an odd perfect number can exist. 

### Song of the Week, March 3-7 2025

**Doing All Right (Queen):** I have known about Queen's discography for quite some time, but I never got much into the lesser known songs, such as [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3js9UOPVsguIDI2WyycfRJ?si=c717fd8748114e00), which is actually fantastic!!
