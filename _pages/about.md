## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, February 12-16, 2024

Let $A = (a_{ij})$ be a real $n\times n$ matrix. Define the quantity $$\alpha := \max_{1 \leq i, j \leq n}\frac12|a_{ij} - a_{ji}|.$$ Then for all eigenvalues $\lambda$ of $A$, we have $$|\text{Im}(\lambda)| \leq \alpha\sqrt{\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}.$$ 

Notice that, as a corollary, a symmetric matrix must have all real eigenvalues!

### Song of the Week, February 12-16, 2024

**Here Comes the Moon:** Who would have thought George Harrison would write [a song](https://open.spotify.com/track/0bIdIeFq2cOUAxGo5AHBI0?si=264a24f4b0cd4c82by) about the moon too: "[O]ther songwriters had had ten years to write 'Here Comes the Moon' after 'Here Comes the Sun', but nobody else wrote it, [so] I might as well do it meself."
