## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and universality. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

### Theorem of the Month, August 2024

If the (generalized) [Riemann Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis) is true, then the odd integers not of the form $a^2+b^2 + 10c^2$ for any integers $a, b, c$ are exactly 3, 7, 21, 33, 43, 67, 79, 87, 133, 217, 219, 223, 253, 307, 391, 679, 2719.

### Song of the Month, August 2024

**Corcovado (Stan Getz, Joao Gilberto):** [This song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5EaU1o7PQE5vhW5HdDWgdO?si=716dae322ffe4dca) is really getting me into Bossa Nova as a genre! I think it is so beautiful and when that saxophone kicks in, it is almost otherworldly.
