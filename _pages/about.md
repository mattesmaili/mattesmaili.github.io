I am currently a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by Professor [Lucas Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statitistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as probability theory and algebraic statistics.
