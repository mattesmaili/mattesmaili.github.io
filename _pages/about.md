## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, March 11-15, 2024

The theorem is that $\pi^{e} < e^{\pi}$, but the coolness lies in the proof: consider the function $f(x) = 1/x$. Clearly, the area under the curve from $x = e$ to $x=\pi$ is less than the area of the rectangle from $e$ to $\pi$ with height $1/e$, since that rectangle contains the area under the curve. Thus we get $$\int_{e}^\pi\frac{1}{x}\,\text{d}x < (\pi - e)\frac{1}{e} \implies \log(\pi) < \frac{\pi}{e} \implies \pi^{e} < e^{\pi}.$$

### Song of the Week, March 11-15, 2024

**Fourth Time Around:** This beautiful [Bob Dylan song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4i4oDSWluhViEzuYIZYtmJ?si=408e14587fca4527) was a response to John Lennon's Norwegian Wood which was itself a respectful imitation of Dylan's storytelling genius! I love them both.
