I am currently a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as probability theory and algebraic statistics.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), Pink Floyd, the Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Gipsy Kings, Eydie Gorme, Siavash, and Chopin.

My favorite proof of all time is the following: There exist $a, b$ irrational such that $a^b$ is rational.

_Proof._ Recall that $\sqrt2$ is irrational. If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt2} is rational, we are done. Otherwise, note that ${\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt2}}^{\sqrt2} = 2$ is rational. $\square$

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)
