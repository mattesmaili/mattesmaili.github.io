## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), Pink Floyd, the Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Gipsy Kings, Eydie Gorme, Siavash, and Chopin.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, October 23-27, 2023

$$\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801}\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4396^{4k}}.$$

### Beatles Song of the Week, October 23-27, 2023

**Julia:** Did you know that [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5FnpXVgDOk2sLT58qM22Of?si=541908710b84486c) has a fingerpicking style ([Travis picking](https://acousticguitar.com/what-is-travis-picking/)) that was claimed by two different people to have been taught to John Lennon!?
