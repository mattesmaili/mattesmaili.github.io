## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I will be graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) starting Fall 2024. I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

I have been doing PhotoShop and graphic design for over a decade now, and I actually opened up a [storefront with original mathematics and statistics t-shirts](https://www.teepublic.com/user/matthew-s-mathematics), so please give it a look!

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

### Theorem of the Week, April 15-19, 2024

This week's theorem is again simple to understand but with an interesting proof: $\sqrt{n}$ is irrational when $n$ is not a perfect square. To see why, note that since $n$ is not a perfect square, its prime factorization *must* include a prime to an odd power. Then if we assume that $\sqrt{n} = a/b$, we have $nb^2 = a^2$, and thus the LHS has that prime showing up an odd number of times, and an even number of times on the RHS, a contradiction to unique prime factorization!

### Song of the Week, April 15-19, 2024

**And I Love Her (Judy Collins cover):** [This song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4pfKv9x0LJulFEf84iZ99b?si=5f4ffd80ddec429e) is the most gorgeous cover of "And I Love Her" by the Beatles I've ever heard! There are so many covers of this song that [I literally have a playlist dedicated to it](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3kdRk6a6ysetLo8wETS0ey?si=bb7c5546799f4888) as well.
