## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as probability theory, random matrix theory, and algebraic statistics.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), Pink Floyd, the Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Gipsy Kings, Eydie Gorme, Siavash, and Chopin.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/Matthew_Resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Month, August 2023

Let $\gamma = \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\displaystyle-\log(n)+\sum_{k=1}^n\frac{1}{k}\right) \approx 0.577$ be the Euler-Mascheroni constant, and $\sigma(n)$ the divisor function (sum of divisors). For example, $\sigma(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12$. Then $$\sigma(n) < e^{\gamma}n\log\log n \text{ for every } n \geq 5041$$ if and only if the Riemann Hypothesis is true.

## Teaching

This Fall 2023, I am a TF for Stat 104, taught by Professor Kevin Rader.
