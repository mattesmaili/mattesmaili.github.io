## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), Pink Floyd, the Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Gipsy Kings, Eydie Gorme, Siavash, and Chopin.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, December 11-15, 2023

Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Then there exists $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ with $|S| = n+2$ such that for any $x, y \in S$, $\|x-y\|_2$ is an odd integer, if and only if $n \equiv 14\ (\text{mod } 16)$. How strange is that!

### Song of the Week, December 11-15, 2023

**Run of the Mill:** George Harrison's first solo work when he left the Beatles is full of masterpieces he wasn't allowed to put on albums during his time as a Beatle. [This song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6sVqehqlRry0goIDS0D0IZ?si=4106ee05f09f4527) in particular is absolutely gorgeous and solidifies this album as the best post-breakup album to me!
