## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/home?authuser=0). I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of mathematics with statistical methods, such as universality, free probability, and random matrix theory. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, pottery, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Clairo, Nick Drake, Mac DeMarco, and Chopin.

I do private tutoring for both statistics and mathematics. Please feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:matthewmallory@fas.harvard.edu) if you would like tutoring for courses in the Harvard Statistics department, or anything else more general. Also check out my Instagram page, [Razi ba Riazi](https://www.instagram.com/razibariazi), for cool mathematics videos, PhD advice, and more. 

### Theorem of the Month, April 2025

$\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.

*Proof.* For any $a \in \mathbb N$, $a^2$ in base three always has 1 as the last non-zero digit, and $2a^2$ always has 2 as the last non-zero digit. Thus $a^2 = 2b^2$ cannot have a non-zero solution.

### Song of the Month, April 2025

**Still Beating (Mac DeMarco):** I love Mac's music, especially the album that [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4LpUpiYoZ2M3Z1kmhn4EQo?si=2387e35f8ac34069) is on! I wanted tickets to his Boston show but it was only resellers for hundreds of dollars :(
