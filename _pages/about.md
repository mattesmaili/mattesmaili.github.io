## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/home?authuser=0). I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of mathematics with statistical methods, such as universality, free probability, and random matrix theory. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, pottery, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Clairo, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, and Chopin.

I do private tutoring for both statistics and mathematics. Please feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:matthewmallory@fas.harvard.edu) if you would like tutoring for courses in the Harvard Statistics department, or anything else more general. Also check out my Instagram page, [Razi ba Riazi](https://www.instagram.com/razibariazi), for cool mathematics videos, PhD advice, and more. 

### Theorem of the Week, March 10-14 2025

There exists a constant *Khinchin's constant*
        $$K := \prod_{n=1}^\infty\left(1 + \frac{1}{n(n+2)}\right)^{\log_2(n)} \approx 2.68545$$
    such that for almost every $x \in \mathbb{R}$, if $x = (a_0; a_1, a_2, \ldots)$, then 
$$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\prod_{i=1}^na_i\right)^{1/n} = K.$$

### Song of the Week, March 10-14 2025

**20191009 I Like Her (Mac DeMarco):** A few years ago Mac DeMacro released a ton of previously unreleased material with all literally no names, such as  [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3oUn55qKRZ1JFzfQNbJjS1?si=84535dd4a85f48e8), and some of them are amazing!
