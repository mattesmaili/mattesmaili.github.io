## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), Pink Floyd, the Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Gipsy Kings, Eydie Gorme, Siavash, and Chopin.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, November 27-December 1, 2023

$$22\arctan\left(\frac{24478}{873121}\right) + 17\arctan\left(\frac{685601}{69049993}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}.$$

### Beatles Song of the Week, November 27-December 1, 2023

**I'm Only Sleeping:** [This song](https://open.spotify.com/track/2ylCrFiBu98SC0vFfaCent?si=d013e41850464379) has one of my favorite lines: Everybody seems to think I'm lazy \\ I don't mind, I think they're crazy \\ Runnin' everywhere at such a speed \\ 'Til they find there's no need!
