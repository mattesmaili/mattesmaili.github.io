## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I will be graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) starting Fall 2024. I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

### Theorem of the Week, April 1-5, 2024

$\pi$ is irrational! Although we all know this one to be true, I only recently discovered a marvelously short proof that only uses elementary calculus, which [you can find here](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-53/issue-6/A-simple-proof-that-pi-is-irrational/bams/1183510788.full).

### Song of the Week, April 1-5, 2024

**Coyote:** There's a [really funny video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeaO5UZ5OcI) of Joni Mitchell singing [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5fdjxHzBILxMXRrbbOVupJ?si=ca70d03941e14b1b) with Bob Dylan, and he looks so nervous being in the presence of this legend!!
