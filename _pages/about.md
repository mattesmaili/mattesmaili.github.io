## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and universality. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

### Theorem of the Week, October 14-18, 2024

There is only one quadratic bijection between $\mathbb{N}$ and $\mathbb{N}^2$, and it is $f(x, y) = \tfrac12\left((x+y)^2 + 3x + y\right)^2$ (ok, $f(y, x)$ makes it two but whatever). 

### Song of the Week, October 14-18, 2024

**I Don't Owe You Anything (The Smiths):** I've been a Smiths fan for a while but only recently discovered [this beautiful song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4WKdgb3xzbTSU7WT3kK3na?si=b9ac9eab8c984bc5) of theirs!
