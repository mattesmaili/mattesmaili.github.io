## About Me ([CV here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/Resume.pdf))

I am currently a rising fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/home?authuser=0). I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of mathematics with statistical methods, such as universality, free probability, theoretical machine learning, and random matrix theory. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, making pottery, shooting film photography, tea culture, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Clairo, Nick Drake, Mac DeMarco, and Chopin.

I do private tutoring for both statistics and mathematics. Please feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:matthewmallory@fas.harvard.edu) if you would like tutoring for courses in the Harvard Statistics department, or really anything involving mathematics or statistics. Also check out my Instagram page, [Razi ba Riazi](https://www.instagram.com/razibariazi), for cool mathematics videos, PhD advice, and more!

### Theorem of the Month, June 2025

There exists a constant $a = 1.00536773279814724017\ldots$ such that $\lfloor a^{10^{10n}}\rfloor$ is prime for every single $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$! How bizarre is that?
        
### Song of the Month, June 2025

**Disney Girls (The Beach Boys):** Rest in peace to the legend, Brian Wilson! So many Beach Boys songs, such as [this one](https://open.spotify.com/track/17qLiavc8woWHAPAGZD0Py?si=577e8dc30ca84d2d), invoke a sense of nostaliga for a time I never even experienced myself. Living near Disneyland myself, I always feel that sense of magic they allude to when I visit.
