## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, March 4-8, 2024

There exists a constant (*Khinchin's constant*) $$K := \prod_{n=1}^\infty\left(1 + \frac{1}{n(n+2)}\right)^{\log_2(n)} \approx 2.68545$$ such that for almost every $x \in \mathbb R$, if $x = [a_0; a_1, a_2, \ldots]$, then $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\prod_{i=1}^na_i\right)^{1/n} = K.$$

### Song of the Week, March 4-8, 2024

**Mother Nature's Son:** When I first heard [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6TjUg1cTUzWHbal6yQAi7c?si=3548e4bdb6624d69), I thought the intro was someone's bad rendition of [Michelle](https://open.spotify.com/track/5By7Pzgl6TMuVJG168VWzS?si=b9af231d080a4047)! Little did I know it is an absolutely gorgeous song off the White Album! :)
