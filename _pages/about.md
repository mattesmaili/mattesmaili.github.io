## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I will be graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) starting Fall 2024. I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

I have been doing PhotoShop and graphic design for over a decade now, and I actually opened up a [storefront with original mathematics and statistics t-shirts](https://www.teepublic.com/user/matthew-s-mathematics), so please give it a look!

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

### Theorem of the Week, April 22-26, 2024

Take $n$ fixed unit vectors $v_1$, ..., $v_n \in \mathbb{S}^{n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. Then for a given random variable $Z \sim \text{Unif}(\mathbb{S}^{n-1})$, let $B_i = \text{sign}(v_i^\intercal Z)$, $1 \leq i \leq n$. Then these $B_i$ are Rademacher distributed with correlation $\text{cor}(B_i, B_j) = \frac{\pi - 2\theta_{i,j}}{\pi}$, where $\theta_{i,j} = \text{arccos}\left(v_i^\intercal v_j\right)$ is the angle between the two fixed vectors.

### Song of the Week, April 22-26, 2024

**Birthday:** I used to make fun of [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ABegtCPBMMJaMpfDyATjE?si=7042daebf4dc4df6) quite a bit, but I never realized how wonderful the middle/bridge section is, I love the guitar and piano combination there!
