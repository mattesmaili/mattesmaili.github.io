## About Me ([CV here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/Resume.pdf))

I am currently a rising fourth-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/home?authuser=0). I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of mathematics with statistical methods, such as universality, free probability, theoretical machine learning, and random matrix theory. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of research, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, making pottery, shooting film photography, tea culture, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Clairo, Nick Drake, Mac DeMarco, and Chopin.

I do private tutoring for both statistics and mathematics. Please feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:matthewmallory@fas.harvard.edu) if you would like tutoring for courses in the Harvard Statistics department, or really anything involving mathematics or statistics. Also check out my Instagram page, [Razi ba Riazi](https://www.instagram.com/razibariazi), for cool mathematics videos, PhD advice, and more!

### Theorem of the Month, July 2025

Let $A$ be a subset of a topological space. Define $kA := \text{clos}(A)$ and $cA := A^c$. Then the maximum number of unique sets that can be obtained by repeated applications of closure and complement is exactly 14! As an example, take $A = (0, 1) \cup (1, 2)\cup \{3\} \cup ([4, 5]\cap\mathbb{Q})\subseteq \mathbb{R}$. Then the 14 sets are $A, cA, kcA, ckcA, kckcA, ckckcA, kckckcA, ckckckcA, kA, ckA, kckA, ckckA, kckckA, ckckckA$.    

### Song of the Month, July 2025

**That's Not Me (The Beach Boys):** I don't know what it is about [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/0VJZtH2OjNKskNegMVIzYR?si=2fa99a2674b94b72) or any of the ones on Pet Sounds, but there's something so magical in them!
