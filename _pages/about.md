## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/home?authuser=0). I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of mathematics with statistical methods, such as universality, free probability, and random matrix theory. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, pottery, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Clairo, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, and Chopin.

I do private tutoring for both statistics and mathematics. Please feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:matthewmallory@fas.harvard.edu) if you would like tutoring for courses in the Harvard Statistics department, or anything else more general. Also check out my Instagram page, [Razi ba Riazi](https://www.instagram.com/razibariazi), for cool mathematics videos, PhD advice, and more. 

### Theorem of the Week, March 31-April 4 2025

How cool is this sum of binomial coefficient powers? $$\sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k}^{-1} = \frac{n+1}{2^{n+1}}\sum_{k=1}^{n+1}\frac{2^k}{k}$$ $$\sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k} = 2^n$$ $$\sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k}^{2} = {2n\choose n}$$ $$\sum_{k=0}^n{n \choose k}^{3} = \sum_{k=0}^n{n\choose k}^2{2k \choose n}.$$

### Song of the Week, March 31-April 4 2025

**Time of the Season (The Zombies):** For some reason [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6ub8sQIKHkyYK4KlB9gbxh?si=bcb885cfe09e4adf) has really blown up again, and I love it! My favorite song by them is "Tell Her No."
