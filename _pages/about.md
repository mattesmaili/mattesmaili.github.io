## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I will be graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) starting Fall 2024. I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

### Theorem of the Week, June 3-7, 2024

If $a, b, c$ are positive, then $$\frac{a}{b+c} + \frac{b}{a+c} + \frac{c}{a+b} \geq \frac32.$$

### Song of the Week, June 3-7, 2024

**Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels):** I always loved Jim Croce, and didn't realize how good [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4mQtXW0vrHC3oTkA1mQsb0?si=a09a6523106e45e0) really was. It's so sad to know we lost him so young!
