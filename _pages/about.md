## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and algebraic statistics.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), Pink Floyd, the Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Gipsy Kings, Eydie Gorme, Siavash, and Chopin.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/Matthew_Resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, October 2-6, 2023

Let $p(z) \in \mathbb C[z]$ be a polynomial of degree three over $\mathbb C$ with roots $z_1$, $z_2$, and $z_3$. In other words, $p(z) = c(z - z_1)(z-z_2)(z-z_3)$ for some $c \in \mathbb C$. Also assume that the roots are not collinear, meaning they form a triangle $T$ in the complex plane. Then the foci of the unique ellipse inscribed inside $T$ which is tangent to each side at the midpoint are the roots of $p'(z)$.

As a corollary, if $T$ is equilateral, then $p'\left(\frac{z_1+z_2+z_3}{3}\right) = 0$.

### Beatles Song of the Week, October 2-6, 2023

**Martha My Dear:** [This song](https://open.spotify.com/track/1swmf4hFMJYRNA8Rq9PVaW?si=0230d09e57544620) has such a great piano and violin part, and also Martha is Paul's Old English sheepdog! :')
