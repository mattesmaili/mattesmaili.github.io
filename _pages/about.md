## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), Pink Floyd, the Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Gipsy Kings, Eydie Gorme, Siavash, and Chopin.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, October 30-November 3, 2023

Let $P$ be a polygon sitting in $\mathbb R^2$ with all vertices lying on $\mathbb Z^2$. Let $i$ be the number of elements of $\mathbb Z^2$ inside of $P$, and $b$ the number of elements of $\mathbb Z^2$ on the boundary of $P$. Then $\text{Area}(P) = i + \frac{b}{2} - 1$. How crazy is that!?

### Beatles Song of the Week, October 30-November 3, 2023

**Now and Then:** Holy crap, the last new Beatles song ever comes out this Thursday!!! Check out [the trailer for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgFTpwB_uII) here. The story goes that they wanted to add this song to their anthology projects in 1995, but George Harrison did not like it, mainly due to them not being able to extract John's vocals from his piano demo in the 70s. Now with new AI technology, it is possible!
