## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and universality. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

### Theorem of the Week, November 4-8, 2024

$22\arctan\left(\frac{24478}{873121}\right) + 17\arctan\left(\frac{685601}{69049993}\right) = \frac{\pi}{4}$.

### Song of the Week, November 4-8, 2024

**I Won (The Sundays):** I have been loving this artist in general, and [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3jT3MU6PxJ6aZdGeTR2uyH?si=64e0dd79aadb41ae) is really a great one from their most classic album!!
