I am currently a first-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by Professor [Lucas Janson](http://lucasjanson.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statitistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as probability theory and algebraic statistics.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the guitar & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the Beatles, Pink Floyd, the Smiths, Led Zeppelin, Gipsy Kings, Eydie Gorme, Siavash, and Chopin. Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about any of these things!

Please find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/Matthew_Resume.pdf).





![](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/david.png) If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be David Eisenbud's **_Commutative Algebra with a view towards Algebraic Geometry_**. I am an attempt to write on commutative algebra in a way that includes the geometric ideas that played a great role in its formation; with a view, in short, towards Algebraic Geometry. I cover the material that graduate students studying Algebraic Geometry - and in particular those  studying the book Algebraic Geometry by Robin Hartshorne - should know.
