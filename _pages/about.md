## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), advised by [Dr. Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/home?authuser=0). I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). Broadly, I am interested in the intersection of mathematics with statistical methods, such as universality, free probability, and random matrix theory. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Pure Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, pottery, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Clairo, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, and Chopin.

I do private tutoring for both statistics and mathematics. Please feel free to [reach out to me by email](mailto:matthewmallory@fas.harvard.edu) if you would like tutoring for courses in the Harvard Statistics department, or anything else more general. Also check out my Instagram page, [Razi ba Riazi](https://www.instagram.com/razibariazi), for cool mathematics videos, PhD advice, and more. 

### Theorem of the Month, February 2025

Recall that $(a, b, c) \in \mathbb{N}^3$ is a *Pythagorean triple* if $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. Well, it turns out that $N = 7824$ is the largest integer such that we can color all the numbers $1, 2, \ldots, N$ red and blue without any Pythagorean triple being all red or all blue. For every number $7825$ or larger, this is provably impossible, because $$7825^2 = 625^2 + 7800^2 = 5180^2 + 5865^2$$ ruins everything!

### Song of the Month, February 2025

**Glory of the Snow (Clairo):** I have become a huge fan of Clairo since her Charm album came out and [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/4JLBaHFkjxnbf9X0D8G3zQ?si=f5e15dc20d7f4267) is by far my favorite, along with Terrapin!
