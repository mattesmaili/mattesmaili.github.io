## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/). In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning.

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

You can find my CV [here](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/new_resume.pdf).

### Theorem of the Week, April 1-5, 2024

This theorem I actually derived myself! For $n$ even, $$\prod_{p \text{ prime}}\frac{p^n-1}{p^n+1} = (-1)^{\tfrac{n}{2}+1}\frac{2B_{2n}}{{2n \choose n}B_n^2},$$ where $B_n$ is the $n$-th Bernoulli number! For example, when $n = 2$ or $4$ we get $2/5$ and $6/7$, respectively.

### Song of the Week, April 1-5, 2024

**Coyote:** There's a [really funny video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeaO5UZ5OcI) of Joni Mitchell singing [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5fdjxHzBILxMXRrbbOVupJ?si=ca70d03941e14b1b) with Bob Dylan, and he looks so nervous being in the presence of this legend!!
