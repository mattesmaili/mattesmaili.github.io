## About Me

I am currently a second-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I will be graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) starting Fall 2024. I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and theoretical machine learning. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to talk about mathematics or anything else above! :^)

### Theorem of the Week, April 8-12, 2024

$\pi$ is irrational! Although we all know this one to be true, I only recently discovered a marvelously short proof that only uses elementary calculus, which [you can find here](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-53/issue-6/A-simple-proof-that-pi-is-irrational/bams/1183510788.full).

### Song of the Week, April 8-12, 2024

**What's Going On:** The bass player for [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Um9toULmYFGCpvaIPFw7l?si=c7004c86479e4b8d), the legendary [James Jamerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jamerson), was so drunk while doing it that he literally played the entire bass line lying down flat on his back.
