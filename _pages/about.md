## About Me

I am currently a third-year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at [Harvard University](https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/), where I am graciously supported by the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I am broadly interested in the intersection of pure mathematics with statistical methods, such as free probability, random matrix theory, and universality. In June 2022, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics and B.S. in Statistics at [UCLA](https://ww3.math.ucla.edu/).

Outside of class, I am interested in lots of different things! I love playing the [guitar](https://mattesmaili.github.io/files/guitar.png) & piano, cooking, shooting film photography, playing chess, learning languages, and more. My favorite artists are the [Beatles](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/07ZKf7841juhmGlI6LMfBd?si=4511ac89f1d14618), the Smiths, Pink Floyd, the Beach Boys, the Doors, Nick Drake, Eydie Gorme, Chopin, and Kourosh Yaghmaei.

### Theorem of the Week, October 1-4, 2024

It is my birthweek, so I figured I'd share a cool probability fact: If you have 23 people in a room, there is a greater than 50% chance that two of them share a birthday!

### Song of the Week, October 1-4, 2024

**Misty (Ella Fitzgerald):** I have to say that Ella Fitzgerald's version of [this classic Jazz piece](https://open.spotify.com/track/4kF394GKEnI13QdZBM9mxM?si=64c7cc27128543db) is absolutely my favorite!! Such a timeless song.
